# Capstone ML Regression Project - Energy Consumption Prediction

![Project Logo/Visualization/Image]

## Overview

This GitHub repository contains the code and documentation for my Capstone Machine Learning Regression project, focusing on predicting energy consumption using the "Data_application_energy" dataset. In this project, I have explored various regression techniques and models to forecast energy consumption, aiming to provide valuable insights for energy efficiency and consumption optimization.

## About the Project

In this Capstone project, I have tackled the challenge of energy consumption prediction by leveraging machine learning regression techniques. The primary goals of this project include:

- Preprocessing and exploratory data analysis of the "Data_application_energy" dataset.
- Training and evaluating multiple regression models for energy consumption prediction.
- Providing comprehensive documentation and insights into the project's findings.
- Demonstrating proficiency in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the "Data_application_energy" dataset, which contains [brief description of the dataset, its source, and any relevant details]. You can find the dataset [provide a link to the dataset source if available].

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `data/`: This directory contains the dataset used for this project.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, preprocessing, and model development.
- `src/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `results/`: This folder stores the model checkpoints, evaluation metrics, and visualizations.
- `docs/`: Documentation files related to the project, including project proposal, report, and presentation.
- `LICENSE`: The license under which this project is distributed.

## Installation

To run the code and reproduce the results, you'll need to set up a Python environment with the required dependencies. Please follow the installation instructions provided in the [Installation](link-to-installation-doc.md) documentation.

## Usage

To train and evaluate regression models for energy consumption prediction, you can follow the steps outlined in the [Usage](link-to-usage-doc.md) documentation. It includes detailed instructions on running the code and reproducing the results.

## Results

In the [Results](link-to-results-doc.md) section, you'll find detailed insights, visualizations, and model performance metrics. I have also discussed the implications of the results and potential applications in real-world scenarios.

## Contributing

I welcome contributions from the open-source community. If you have any suggestions, improvements, or bug fixes, please submit a pull request. For major changes, please open an issue to discuss the proposed changes.
