## Introduction

Bike share demand prediction is a critical aspect of urban transportation planning. This project focuses on using machine learning techniques to predict bike rental demand in Seoul, aiding in efficient resource allocation and city planning.

## Dataset

The dataset `SeoulBikeData.csv` is included in the  üìÅ `data` directory. It contains information about bike rentals, including weather conditions, temperature, humidity, and other relevant features.

The `SeoulBikeData.csv` file contains the following columns:

- **Date**: Year-Month-Day
- **Rented Bike count**: Count of bikes rented at each hour
- **Hour**: Hour of the day
- **Temperature**: Temperature in Celsius
- **Humidity**: %
- **Windspeed**: m/s
- **Visibility**: 10m
- **Dew point temperature**: Celsius
- **Solar radiation**: MJ/m2
- **Rainfall**: mm
- **Snowfall**: cm
- **Seasons**: Winter, Spring, Summer, Autumn
- **Holiday**: Holiday/No holiday
- **Functional Day**: NonFunctional/Functional Day

## Dependencies

The project is developed using Python and relies on the following libraries:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Documentation

The project involves the following steps:\
    1. Data Cleaning and Preparation\
    2. Exploratory Data Analysis\
    3. Visualization and Insights\
    4. Hypothesis Testing\
    5. Feature Enginerring & Data Pre-processing\
    6. ML Model Impelmentation

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
The first step in this project involves cleaning and preparing the data. This includes checking for missing data, removing duplicates, and converting data types. Some of the specific tasks involved in this step include:

- Handling missing data
- Removing duplicates
- Converting data types
- TimeSeries Analysis

### Exploratory Data Analysis
The next step in the project is to conduct exploratory data analysis.
This involves examining the data to understand its distribution, central tendencies, and correlations between variables.

Some of the specific tasks involved in this step include:

Examining the distribution of numerical variables
Examining the relationship between variables
Identifying patterns and trends in the data
Identifying the factors that influence booking cancellations
Visualization and Insights
The final step in the project is to create visualizations and derive insights from the data.
This involves creating graphs and charts to help understand the data and communicate the findings to others.

Some of the specific tasks involved in this step include:
1. Creating visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and bar charts
2. Deriving insights from the data
3. Communicating the findings to others
4. The project concludes with a summary of the findings and recommendations for future analysis.
